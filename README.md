# About this project

This is my first backend project using golang :D

In this project I used echo as a router, before using echo I tried using gorilla / mux but there were some obstacles in the end I chose echo as a router besides that echo has very good documentation.

For databases I use Mongodb, I chose Mongodb because the data structure in Mongodb can be very flexible, which is very useful when developing applications.
